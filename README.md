# Art-style-transfer-Neural-Network



This notebook implements neural style transfer using the VGG19 model. It takes a content image and a style image as input and generates a stylized output image.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy
- Pillow


The notebook will generate stylized images at various epochs. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell. Key steps include:

Loading the content and style images.
Defining the neural network model.
Setting up the transformation and normalization functions.
Calculating the content and style losses.
Running the optimization loop to generate the stylized image.
